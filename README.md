#Meteor Mash
####A Meteor + Raspberry Pi maker project
==================================================================================================================================================================================
###Desciption
    TL;DR version: An app to be a DJ at a local party. 
    
    A web app using meteor that allows a party to show a playlist of songs and anyone in the nearby party can queue up and request a song. The app will dynamically add songs into the queue that everyone can see all at once. Also a downvote system that if enough people vote down, the song will dissappear and not play. The app also uses a Raspbery PI to connect to speakers and queue up the songs and play them. It will also use spotify as a backbone to curate the content and find songs and possibly add in ability for local storage and check for music there as well.
